    <h2>Flag of Azerbaijan</h2><hr>
    <blockquote title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Azerbaijan">The national flag of Azerbaijan (Azerbaijani: Azərbaycan bayrağı),<br>
         often referred to in Azerbaijani as Üçrəngli bayraq (English: Tricolour flag)<br> is a horizontal tricolour featuring three equally sized bars of bright blue,<br> red, and green, with a white crescent and an eight-pointed star in the centre.<br>The flag has become the predominant and most recognizable national symbols of Azerbaijan.<br>

        The Azerbaijani Flag Day was established by law n. 595 of 17 November 2009,<br> which is held every year on 9 November.This celebration commemorates the first official adoption<br> of the tricolour as a national flag by the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, which happened on 9 November 1918.<br> The flag was used by the republic until the 1920 Soviet invasion of Azerbaijan.It was revived with slight variations<br>to the colours and size on 5 February 1991 following the country's independence from the Soviet Union.<br> The bright blue symbolizes Azerbaijan's Turkic heritage, the red stands for progress, and the green represents Islam,<br>the religion of the majority of Azerbaijanis.
        
        The flag is referred to in the national Constitution and mentioned two times in the anthem.<br>On land, the flag is used as the civil, state and war flag; at sea, it is used as the civil, state, and naval ensign, as well as the naval jack.<br>The flag also has official status in Nakhchivan, an autonomous republic within Azerbaijan.<br> The Azerbaijani law regulates the flag's use and display, protecting it from desecration.</blockquote>
